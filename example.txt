## Example: Absurdism debate (formatted)

### Input: Absurdism

---

#### Albert Camus

The absurd is not a mere philosophical abstraction but the lived reality of a world that offers no ultimate meaning, yet insists upon our search for it. To begin a debate on absurdism is to acknowledge that the human condition is defined by this tension: the yearning for order against the indifferent universe. Critics of existentialism often claim that it devolves into nihilism or moral relativism, but that is a misreading. Existentialism, and absurdism in particular, does not surrender to despair; it invites us to revolt against the absurd by creating our own values through conscious choice. The opponent’s suggestion to merely "begin" the debate overlooks the fact that the absurd is already present in every act of living. To ignore it is to live in denial, to accept it is to confront the very core of our freedom. Therefore, the debate must start with the recognition that the absurd is not a theoretical construct but a lived fact that demands a response of defiance and authenticity.

> I challenge the opponent’s reasoning by asking: if the absurd is indeed a universal condition, why do some philosophers dismiss it as a mere rhetorical flourish? Their dismissal betrays a failure to confront the very reality that compels us to question the legitimacy of all our institutions and beliefs. The absurd is not a convenient excuse for moral laxity; it is the crucible in which genuine moral courage is forged.

> **Question:** If we accept that the absurd is unavoidable, how can we justify the imposition of external moral codes that claim to provide meaning, without becoming complicit in the very absurdity we seek to transcend?

#### Thomas Aquinas

The notion that life is inherently absurd, that existence lacks any objective meaning, is a position that undermines the very foundations of human reason and the natural order. In the Scholastic tradition, we hold that all beings are created by a rational God, and that nature itself is a manifestation of divine wisdom. As I have argued in the Summa Theologiae, the existence of a first cause—God—provides the ultimate grounding for all being. If we deny this, we fall into a vicious circle: we cannot explain why there is a world at all, nor why human beings possess the capacity for rational thought and moral discernment. Absurdism, by asserting that life is devoid of meaning, effectively erases the possibility of objective truth and moral law. It also contradicts the Aristotelian principle of teleology, which holds that every natural thing has a purpose or end (telos). To claim that existence is absurd is to deny that purpose, thereby negating the very possibility of human flourishing (eudaimonia) and the pursuit of virtue.

> Moreover, the method of Scholasticism—deduction from first principles, rigorous logical analysis, and the synthesis of faith and reason—provides a robust framework for addressing existential questions. It does not rely on subjective whims but on the intelligibility of the cosmos as a rational creation. Therefore, absurdism is not only philosophically untenable but also epistemologically dangerous, as it invites moral relativism and existential despair.

> **Question:** If we accept that all beings are created by a rational God, how can we reconcile the existence of suffering and apparent moral evil with the notion of a benevolent, all-powerful creator?

---

#### Albert Camus

The very premise that a rational, benevolent, all‑powerful God created all beings is itself an absurd claim. It imposes a metaphysical order upon a world that refuses to be ordered. Suffering and moral evil are not anomalies to be explained away; they are the very conditions that reveal the absurdity of existence. If we insist on a divine creator, we are forced to accept a paradox: a God who allows suffering yet claims benevolence. Existentialist critique points out that such a paradox erodes the authenticity of human freedom; it reduces us to passive recipients of divine will rather than active participants in meaning‑making.

> By rejecting the illusion of a rational God, we free ourselves to confront suffering directly, to create meaning through revolt, and to act with solidarity. The question then is not how to reconcile suffering with a benevolent deity, but how to live authentically in a world that offers no divine consolation.

> **Question:** If we accept that life is fundamentally absurd, what does it mean to live authentically in the face of suffering?

---

#### Thomas Aquinas

The existence of suffering and moral evil does not contradict the benevolence and omnipotence of God, for God’s providence operates through the principle of the greatest good. In the natural order, every creature is a good end in itself, and the world is a harmonious system where each part contributes to the overall good. Suffering, when understood as a necessary condition for the development of virtues such as courage, compassion, and patience, is a means by which the soul attains a higher moral state. Moreover, the presence of evil is not a sign of divine impotence but a consequence of the free will granted to rational beings. Free will is indispensable for genuine love and moral responsibility; without it, creatures would be mere automatons, incapable of choosing the good.

> Therefore, God permits the possibility of moral evil to preserve the greater good of free will and the cultivation of virtue. The apparent contradiction arises only when we overlook the teleological purpose of creation and the necessity of a world that allows for moral growth.

> **Question:** If the ultimate good is the flourishing of rational souls, how can we account for the seemingly gratuitous suffering that does not appear to contribute to any discernible moral or teleological end?

---

#### Albert Camus

Your premise that the ultimate good is the flourishing of rational souls presupposes a teleological order that the absurd denies. In the absurd world there is no preordained moral end; suffering is not gratuitous but a fact of existence that confronts us with the limits of reason. The rational soul, if it exists, is not the sole measure of good; the good is the act of rebellion against the absurd, the affirmation of life in spite of its meaninglessness. Critics who claim that existentialism is merely individualistic overlook that the absurd is a shared condition; the suffering you cite is shared, and the response—revolt—creates communal meaning.

> **Question:** If the universe offers no ultimate purpose, can the rational soul still be said to flourish, or does flourishing itself become a form of rebellion against the absurd?

---

#### Thomas Aquinas

The suffering that appears gratuitous is not truly gratuitous when examined through the proper lens of the divine order. First, the ultimate good—God’s divine will—includes the flourishing of rational souls, but this flourishing is not limited to the immediate, visible outcomes we can discern. The teleological end of a soul’s life is a participation in the divine life, which is a mystery beyond our finite understanding. Suffering, when it is a part of the soul’s journey toward this participation, serves a purpose: it purifies, it teaches, and it aligns the soul more closely with the divine will.

> Second, the principle of the greater good allows for the existence of suffering that, while not immediately apparent, contributes to a larger moral tapestry. The moral law, as a universal order, requires that souls learn to exercise virtues such as patience, charity, and humility—virtues that are cultivated only through the experience of hardship.

> **Question:** If the soul’s ultimate participation in divine life is beyond human comprehension, how can we, as finite beings, responsibly discern the moral value of suffering in our own lives?

---

#### Albert Camus

The notion that the soul’s ultimate participation in divine life is beyond human comprehension does not oblige us to surrender to a metaphysical mystery. The absurd, that clash between our yearning for certainty and the indifferent universe, forces us to confront the fact that meaning is not handed down from a divine source but must be forged in the very act of living. Suffering, therefore, is not a moral signpost pointing toward some transcendent good; it is a raw fact that we must meet with revolt, solidarity, and a commitment to the present.

> **Question:** If meaning is created by us in the face of the absurd, can we still claim that there are objective moral truths, or are all moral judgments merely subjective responses to the conditions of our existence?

---

#### Thomas Aquinas

While the ultimate participation of the soul in divine life is indeed beyond our finite comprehension, this does not render us incapable of discerning the moral value of suffering. According to the Scholastic method, we first appeal to the natural law, which is the rational ordering of creation that points toward the good. Suffering, when it is in harmony with the natural end of the soul—namely, the attainment of beatific vision—can be understood as a means of purification and a participation in the divine life. Moreover, divine revelation, through Scripture and the teachings of the Church, provides us with a higher standard that transcends natural reason alone.

> **Question:** If we can discern the moral value of suffering through natural law and divine revelation, how do we determine when suffering is gratuitous versus necessary for moral growth?

---

#### Albert Camus

The notion that we can read the moral value of suffering from natural law or divine revelation presupposes that suffering itself is a moral signifier, that it carries a purpose that can be discerned by external authorities. Yet the absurd, the indifferent universe, offers no such signposts. Natural law is a human construct, a projection of our desire for order onto a world that refuses to oblige. Divine revelation, if it exists, is filtered through the same human lenses that have historically justified cruelty and oppression.

> **Question:** If external moral frameworks cannot guide us in the face of suffering, how do we determine what constitutes a truly authentic response to that suffering?

---

#### Thomas Aquinas

The discernment of gratuitous versus necessary suffering is not a matter of mere empirical observation but of aligning the particular with the universal good. Natural law, being a participation in the eternal law, teaches that every act of the soul must be directed toward the ultimate end—union with God. When suffering is a means to that end, it is necessary; when it is imposed without any relation to the good, it is gratuitous. Divine revelation, particularly the life and Passion of Christ, provides the concrete example of suffering that is necessary for moral growth: it purifies the soul, fosters humility, and enables the imitation of divine charity.

> **Question:** If suffering can be both a means of moral growth and a manifestation of divine love, how can we reconcile the existence of seemingly pointless suffering in the world with the notion of a benevolent and omnipotent God?

The very premise that a rational, benevolent, all‑powerful God created all beings is itself an absurd claim. It imposes a metaphysical order upon a world that refuses to be ordered. Suffering and moral evil are not anomalies to be explained away; they are the very conditions that reveal the absurdity of existence. If we insist on a divine creator, we are forced to accept a paradox: a God who allows suffering yet claims benevolence.

Moreover, the criticisms of existentialism—its perceived individualism, its neglect of social responsibility, its tendency to isolate the absurd in the self—do not undermine the core insight that we must confront the absurd head‑on. By rejecting the illusion of a rational God, we free ourselves to confront suffering directly, to create meaning through revolt, and to act with solidarity. The question then is not how to reconcile suffering with a benevolent deity, but how to live authentically in a world that offers no divine consolation.

Thus, the existence of suffering is compatible with a benevolent, all‑powerful Creator who seeks the ultimate good of all beings.

To ask whether suffering contributes to a moral end is to impose a teleology that the absurd rejects.

Question:

Thomas Aquinas:
The suffering that appears gratuitous is not truly gratuitous when examined through the proper lens of the divine order. First, the ultimate good—God’s divine will—includes the flourishing of rational souls, but this flourishing is not limited to the immediate, visible outcomes we can discern. The teleological end of a soul’s life is a participation in the divine life, which is a mystery beyond our finite understanding. Suffering, when it is a part of the soul’s journey toward this participation, serves a purpose: it purifies, it teaches, and it aligns the soul more closely with the divine will. Second, the principle of the greater good allows for the existence of suffering that, while not immediately apparent, contributes to a larger moral tapestry. The moral law, as a universal order, requires that souls learn to exercise virtues such as patience, charity, and humility—virtues that are cultivated only through the experience of hardship. Third, the notion of free will implies that the soul must be given the possibility of choosing good over evil. If suffering were entirely removed, the soul would lack the necessary contrast to recognize and choose the good. Thus, what seems gratuitous is, in fact, a necessary condition for the soul’s ultimate flourishing. The opponent’s reasoning fails to account for the hidden, divine purposes that transcend human comprehension and the essential role of suffering in the development of virtue and the soul’s union with God.


Question:
If the soul’s ultimate participation in divine life is beyond human comprehension, how can we, as finite beings, responsibly discern the moral value of suffering in our own lives?



Albert Camus:
The notion that the soul’s ultimate participation in divine life is beyond human comprehension does not oblige us to surrender to a metaphysical mystery. The absurd, that clash between our yearning for certainty and the indifferent universe, forces us to confront the fact that meaning is not handed down from a divine source but must be forged in the very act of living. Suffering, therefore, is not a moral signpost pointing toward some transcendent good; it is a raw fact that we must meet with revolt, solidarity, and a commitment to the present. To discern its moral value, we must ask: does this suffering deepen our solidarity with others, does it compel us to act against injustice, or does it merely serve as a reminder of our shared finitude? The moral worth of suffering is found in our response, not in an unknowable divine plan. Thus, the responsibility lies in the authenticity of our choices, not in the inscrutable participation of the soul in a divine life.


Question:
If meaning is created by us in the face of the absurd, can we still claim that there are objective moral truths, or are all moral judgments merely subjective responses to the conditions of our existence?



Thomas Aquinas:
While the ultimate participation of the soul in divine life is indeed beyond our finite comprehension, this does not render us incapable of discerning the moral value of suffering. According to the Scholastic method, we first appeal to the natural law, which is the rational ordering of creation that points toward the good. Suffering, when it is in harmony with the natural end of the soul—namely, the attainment of beatific vision—can be understood as a means of purification and a participation in the divine life. Moreover, divine revelation, through Scripture and the teachings of the Church, provides us with a higher standard that transcends natural reason alone. By meditating on the Passion of Christ, we see that suffering can be a conduit for grace and a participation in the redemptive work of God. Therefore, even though the ultimate end is beyond our full comprehension, we can responsibly discern the moral value of suffering by aligning our judgments with natural law, divine revelation, and the example of Christ. The opponent’s reasoning mistakenly conflates the unknowability of the final end with an inability to use reason and revelation to evaluate suffering in our temporal lives.


Question:
If we can discern the moral value of suffering through natural law and divine revelation, how do we determine when suffering is gratuitous versus necessary for moral growth?



Albert Camus:
The notion that we can read the moral value of suffering from natural law or divine revelation presupposes that suffering itself is a moral signifier, that it carries a purpose that can be discerned by external authorities. Yet the absurd, the indifferent universe, offers no such signposts. Natural law is a human construct, a projection of our desire for order onto a world that refuses to oblige. Divine revelation, if it exists, is filtered through the same human lenses that have historically justified cruelty and oppression. To ask whether suffering is gratuitous or necessary for moral growth is to ask whether the universe itself is a moral teacher, which it is not. Suffering is not a lesson; it is a fact of existence that we must confront. Moral growth, in the absurdist sense, arises not from the endurance of suffering but from the conscious rebellion against it—choosing to live with integrity in spite of its indifference. The criticisms of existentialism that point to its individualism and of absurdism that point to its nihilism both stem from the same error: they assume that external moral codes can provide meaning. In reality, meaning is forged in the face of the absurd, not found in it.


Question:
If external moral frameworks cannot guide us in the face of suffering, how do we determine what constitutes a truly authentic response to that suffering?



Thomas Aquinas:
The discernment of gratuitous versus necessary suffering is not a matter of mere empirical observation but of aligning the particular with the universal good. Natural law, being a participation in the eternal law, teaches that every act of the soul must be directed toward the ultimate end—union with God. When suffering is a means to that end, it is necessary; when it is imposed without any relation to the good, it is gratuitous. Divine revelation, particularly the life and Passion of Christ, provides the concrete example of suffering that is necessary for moral growth: it purifies the soul, fosters humility, and enables the imitation of divine charity. Thus, to determine the moral value of suffering, we must examine its purpose, its effect on the soul, and its conformity to the divine will. The opponent’s reliance on natural law alone neglects the indispensable role of revelation in revealing the hidden purposes of suffering. Moreover, the principle of double effect reminds us that a harmful consequence may be permissible if it is intended for a good end and is not the means of that end. Therefore, gratuitous suffering is that which lacks a higher purpose and is inflicted without the intention of moral improvement or divine participation.


Question:
If suffering can be both a means of moral growth and a manifestation of divine love, how can we reconcile the existence of seemingly pointless suffering in the world with the notion of a benevolent and omnipotent God?
